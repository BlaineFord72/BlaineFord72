- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data visualization techniques in Tableau and Python, and enhancing my skills in SQL for more robust data management and analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve data analysis, visualization, and storytelling. If you have an interesting dataset or need insights derived from data, I'd love to work together!
